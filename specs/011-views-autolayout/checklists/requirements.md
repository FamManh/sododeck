# Specification Quality Checklist: Saved Views and Auto-Layout

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `$speckit-clarify` or `$speckit-plan`
- Clarified 2026-09-28: built-in views written on first change (FR-001); pins per view (FR-022); settings in a popover from the tab menu (FR-043).
- Mentions of the file format, `pnpm bench` and the constitution's layout engine are kept as project constraints (constitution II, V; AGENTS.md), as in earlier specs.
